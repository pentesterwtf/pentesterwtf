Anyway, this gets often re-iterated, but when it&amp;rsquo;s said so succinctly, it needs to be preserved for the sake of posterity: I&amp;rsquo;d like to quote Dave Aitel directly from https://seclists.org/dailydave/2021/q3/0 on Active Directory: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; AD is a system where any time you hack any computer on the network, you can become the domain controller, and own the whole company.</description></item><item><title>Tips for new (penetration testers) players</title><link>/blog/2022/01/new-starter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 18:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/01/new-starter/</guid><description>Suppose you&amp;rsquo;ve just started in the industry; congratulations and welcome to the shitshow.
