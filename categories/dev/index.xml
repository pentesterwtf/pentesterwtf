On top of that, is the hellscape of licensing your software, and picking components with the right licensing. In short:
Software has licensing (https://choosealicense.com/) if you don&amp;rsquo;t pick a license, in AU it ends up being copyrighted No idea about other countries These licenses have conditions, things like: If it breaks, it&amp;rsquo;s not the authors problem (warranty) If it breaks, it&amp;rsquo;s not the authors fault (liability) Private usage limitations, commercial usage Licensing restreictions of systems using the library Conditions around the disclosure of source code This can bite you, especially in cases of picking components which have a GPL license (https://choosealicense.</description></item><item><title>Reading code isn't the same as knowing a language</title><link>/blog/2021/02/reading-code-v-languages/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/02/reading-code-v-languages/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a shameless repost, but the paper is pretty fascinating and speaks for itself.
From the Massachusetts Institute of Technology:
To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language: Neuroscientists find that interpreting code activates a general-purpose brain network, but not language-processing centers.&amp;quot; ScienceDaily.

With that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;d like to reiterate:
If you&amp;rsquo;re writing code malware, and need to generate deterministic identifiers for data - such as if you&amp;rsquo;re scraping a website comparing processes on an endpoint to ones you care about (i.e. msbuild), and your code looks like this:</description></item><item><title>Generating fast hashes</title><link>/blog/2020/xxhash/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 18:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/xxhash/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re writing code, and need to generate deterministic identifiers for data - such as if you&amp;rsquo;re scraping a website, and your code looks like this:
