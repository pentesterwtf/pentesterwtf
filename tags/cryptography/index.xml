This broke a lot of people&amp;rsquo;s CI pipelines, which seemed like a massively overblown problem (protip - you can update your CI runners to have rust support, it&amp;rsquo;ll work fine, trust me).

&amp;ldquo;UUIDS GENERALLY DO NOT MEET SECURITY REQUIREMENTS&amp;rdquo; Thanks to littlemaninmyhead, which can be found at https://littlemaninmyhead.wordpress.com/2015/11/22/cautionary-note-uuids-should-generally-not-be-used-for-authentication-tokens/
Summarised as &amp;ldquo;Do not assume that UUIDs are hard to guess; they should not be used as security capabilities (identifiers whose mere possession grants access), for example.&amp;rdquo;
