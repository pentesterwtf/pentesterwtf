This all started with a blog post on building a reliable SMM backdoor, but went into a rabbit hole. These were my notes when reading into it.
My understanding of sitting in SMM is:
System Management Mode (SMM) &amp;ldquo;pauses&amp;rdquo; the OS, then runs its own code Pause - Comes as a &amp;lsquo;System Management Interrupt (SMI)&amp;rsquo;, highest priority, can&amp;rsquo;t be masked Copied into memory at power-on(DXE phase?</description></item></channel></rss>
