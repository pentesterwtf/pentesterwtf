With that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;d like to reiterate:
If you&amp;rsquo;re writing code malware, and need to generate deterministic identifiers for data - such as if you&amp;rsquo;re scraping a website comparing processes on an endpoint to ones you care about (i.e. msbuild), and your code looks like this:</description></item><item><title>Misc things from 2020</title><link>/blog/2020/2020-misc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 18:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/2020-misc/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m doing this because i&amp;rsquo;ve got too many Trello tickets with little interesting tidbits in them, which sound like something worth sharing.
&amp;ldquo;UUIDS GENERALLY DO NOT MEET SECURITY REQUIREMENTS&amp;rdquo; Thanks to littlemaninmyhead, which can be found at https://littlemaninmyhead.wordpress.com/2015/11/22/cautionary-note-uuids-should-generally-not-be-used-for-authentication-tokens/
Summarised as &amp;ldquo;Do not assume that UUIDs are hard to guess; they should not be used as security capabilities (identifiers whose mere possession grants access), for example.&amp;rdquo;
