What From https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/windows-security-servicing-criteria:
Defense-in-depth security features

These security features are typically &amp;gt;referred to as defense-in-depth features or mitigations because they provide additional security but may have by design limitations that prevent them from fully &amp;gt;mitigating a threat.</description></item></channel></rss>
