This is due to how bad passwords are checked, and is a feature designed to allow password changes that haven&rsquo;t propogated to remote sites, to still be useable.</p><p>The <code>LastBadPasswordAttempt</code> will always be synchronised with the domain controller that happens to be the <a href=https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32490.active-directory-bad-passwords-and-account-lockout.aspx>Primary Domain Controller Emulator</a>, but when this is not available the domain controller handling the request will usually take a while to report a failed login to the user.</p><p>But when the PDCe is not available, what happens? This could be a result of either a network outage, the PDCe host going down, or configuration.</p><p>There is a group policy setting which can turn this off called <a href="https://getadmx.com/?Category=Windows_10_2016&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.NetLogon::Netlogon_AvoidPdcOnWan">Netlogon_AvoidPdcOnWan</a>, but it&rsquo;s unclear how useful that would be from a security perspective; i.e. Does the <code>LastBadPasswordAttempt</code> counter no longer increment on the PDCe for example, allowing an attacker to just try against every domain controller?</p><p>In the case of things like OWA, or knowing a targets branch offices are internet reachable, this could lead to some curious circumstances, such as being able to spray passwords and ignore password policies, as long as you don&rsquo;t lock out an account on any individual domain controller.</p><p>Given this is referenced as a <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/settings-for-minimizing-periodic-wan-traffic#the-avoidpdconwan-entry>recommendation for minimising WAN traffic</a>, this might be more prevelent than one would think.</p><p>Food for thought.</p></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div></div></nav></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','UA-141761824-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
