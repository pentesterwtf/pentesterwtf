These security features are typically >referred to as defense-in-depth features or mitigations because they provide additional security but may have by design limitations that prevent them from fully >mitigating a threat.
[&mldr;]
Any vulnerability or bypass that affects these security features will not be serviced by default, but it may be addressed in a future version or release.</p></blockquote><p>The language throws a bit of shade on Defence in Depth (and mitigations) - &ldquo;because they provide additional security but may have design limitations that prevent them from fully mitigating a threat&rdquo;. Compare this to the definition provided for a Security feature:</p><blockquote><p>[&mldr;]the goal of a security feature is to provide robust protection against a threat and there are expected to be no by-design limitations that would prevent the >security feature from achieving this goal.</p></blockquote><p>Applocker has many known/published bypasses, and has also lead to the <a href=https://github.com/LOLBAS-Project/LOLBAS>lolbins phenomenon</a>.</p><p>It should also be noted that AppLocker wasn&rsquo;t designed for a security purpose, and was mostly intended to stop people from running unlicensed software or help do inventory in the environment. <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview</a>.</p><p>Moving forward, Windows Defender System Guard (WDSG) / Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) are Security Features - but curiously bear the caveat of <code>Bypasses leveraging applications which are permitted by the policy are not in scope.</code> - which is likely a way out of paying bounties on lolbins. More curiously, it looks like Microsoft is writing advice on what lolbins to block <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-block-rules>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-block-rules</a>, which might turn into actual mitigations at some point?</p><p>In fairness to DEP, at least Microsoft will pay out a bounty for a DEP bypass - unlike Applocker (which again, was designed to stop people from playing Halo on their work machine) :)</p></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div></div></nav></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','UA-141761824-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
