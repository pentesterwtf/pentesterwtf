An interesting study was performed in late 2021, surveying a bunch of public servants about their feelings towards working from home vs working from the office.</p><p>Ignoring a handful of sampling issues, such as only a quarter of the respondents were not Australian Public Servant (APS) union members; or inferring from that, most of the respondents were public servants; this shows a clear message from the Australian workforce, best summarised in the authors own words:</p><p>&ldquo;First, our findings show a mismatch between preferred and actual working arrangements. While only a small percentage of employees worked three days a week from home, a fifth of respondents would like to work this amount of time from home. Over a third of employees would like to work from home all the time, or for 80% of their working week.&rdquo;</p><p>The article in question is: <a href=https://www.cpsu.org.au/CPSU/Content/Campaigns/Your_new_normal.aspx>https://www.cpsu.org.au/CPSU/Content/Campaigns/Your_new_normal.aspx</a></p></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div></div></nav></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','UA-141761824-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
