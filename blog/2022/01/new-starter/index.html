Here are some things to consider:</p><p>You are a consultant more than a hacker in this role; the computer side is essential, but you are ultimately attempting to play a game of explaining how wrong something is, while breaking that thing, and you get bonus points for actually breaking something of value.</p><h2 id=organisation>Organisation</h2><p>When dealing with your company/organisation/sweatshop:</p><p>They mostly all suck in different ways, but they&rsquo;re usually in one of these flavours:</p><ul><li>Organisation size/headcount<ul><li>A big place will have layers of policy you don&rsquo;t want</li><li>A small place won&rsquo;t have the budget you need for things</li></ul></li><li>Clientelle<ul><li>Some shops will deal exclusively with different markets, and those markets can suck</li></ul></li><li>The work<ul><li>Mostly a combination of clientele and your sales team (if they exist); some clients might want meaningful work, others may just want you to re-scan a website with Nessus.</li><li>A good litmus test is if the client base does their testing for compliance reasons or if they want to know if it&rsquo;s secure.</li></ul></li><li>Culture / Incentives<ul><li>Some shops are blatant sweatshops. Do not work at these unless you either a) they can pay you buckets of money and that&rsquo;s what you want, or b) you don&rsquo;t have other options, but you&rsquo;re actively looking to make those options happen.</li></ul></li><li>The people
*Figure out what everyone is like; the owners, the team you&rsquo;ll be in, adjacent teams, sales, and management.<ul><li>The sales team will almost always try to just sell things without understanding what they are selling. Sales teams like this are also ubiquitous.</li></ul></li><li>Average skill level<ul><li>Most shops are interested in having a high body count over having more skilled people. These shops have odd incentives and can lead to some funky stuff - reports with <code>alert(1)</code> proof of concepts, vague executive summaries, etc.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Sometimes a large organisation will pretend it&rsquo;s a small organisation when it comes to budget, but a large organisation when it comes to organising the smallest of things. This behaviour can be frustrating, but it is ubiquitous.</p><p>The best advice here is to realise that no matter where you go, your workplace will have silly things - <em>different</em> stupid things, but silly things all the same. Learn what silliness you can tolerate, learn what other shops are like, go where makes you the least unhappy.</p><h2 id=team>Team</h2><p>When dealing with your team:</p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t spam <code>@general</code> with hello/did everyone have a good weekend. Not only does this waste everyone&rsquo;s time, but they&rsquo;ll hate that interruption.</li><li>When asking a question, don&rsquo;t send &lsquo;hi&rsquo; and wait for a response; ask upfront what you want to ask. (See: <a href=https://www.nohello.com/>https://www.nohello.com/</a>)</li><li>Figure out what you&rsquo;re trying to ask, look into it <em>before</em> you ask. There is value in understanding how to ask a good question.</li></ul><h2 id=working-in-an-office-working-remotely>Working in an office, working remotely</h2><ul><li>Reject meetings with no agenda. Know what you&rsquo;re going to, know why you&rsquo;re there, only go to things you <em>have</em> or <em>want</em> to.</li><li>When dealing with meetings involving too many people (I.e. All of them), consider the cost of the meeting.<ul><li>Especially consider the average staff salary in the room, vs the topic
*, I.e. 10 pentesters at 100k/year, for a one-hour meeting - vs the cost of just buying that tool that costs $100/year
*, I.e. <a href=http://gorskecalculator.com/>http://gorskecalculator.com/</a> can be helpful when calculating the actual cost of a weekly team meeting.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Know that you will get a lot more things done with fewer distractions; optimise to have the least number of distractions, context switches, and other nonsense.</p><p>To cite Aaron Swatz of <a href=http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/officespace:>http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/officespace:</a></p><pre><code>People are always asking me how I manage to get so much done. For a while, I tried to impress them with my pearls of wisdom but soon I just sort of gave up. I don't really feel like I do anything special â€” I worry about getting stuff done a lot, but mostly I just sort of do it.

It wasn't until I started working in an office that the question begun to make sense. Since I moved to San Francisco I literally haven't gotten anything done. I haven't finished a book (I finished three on the plane out here), I haven't answered many emails (I used to answer hundreds a day), I've written only a couple blog posts (I used to do one a day), and I haven't written a line of code (I used to write whole programs in the evenings). It's a pretty incredible state of affairs.
</code></pre><h2 id=clients>Clients</h2><p>When dealing with clients:</p><ul><li>You are a consultant; you can ask what you want: Source code, architectural diagrams, admin accounts.<ul><li>Often, pentesters won&rsquo;t ask, which leads to less coverage on an engagement.</li></ul></li><li>If the client asks for something silly, tell them why it&rsquo;s silly, and suggest a better use of time.</li><li>Understand why they&rsquo;re here, understand what they wanted - then consider if that&rsquo;s worth disregarding.</li><li>They are paying you to be an expert, act as an expert.</li><li>Always push for a white box test. You want the best chance of finding cool stuff.</li></ul><p>You probably can&rsquo;t fix most of them, nor is it your job to fix systemic organisational issues - but you can fight hard to get a better scope for the engagement.
Also, remember to be professional; however, to quote a prominent penetration tester at PyCon AU - &ldquo;Being professional isn&rsquo;t wearing a suit, it&rsquo;s giving a shit&rdquo; [1]</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30whGoKOduA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30whGoKOduA</a></p><h3 id=pointless-tests>Pointless tests</h3><p>These come in many flavours:</p><p>Some tests are pointless and just for compliance. They&rsquo;ve been looked at a million times; they don&rsquo;t change; there might even be using good frameworks.
You&rsquo;ll get them; you&rsquo;ll have to do them, get them done and then move on to something more exciting.</p><p>There is no credential / &ldquo;see what you can do&rdquo; tests - Sometimes, you can salvage these, but ultimately looking at a log in page won&rsquo;t give you much coverage. Fight the client on getting a better scope.</p><p>The target just doesn&rsquo;t matter - Getting a shell on a random VPS, which gets zero traffic and no adjacent access is technically deficient but isn&rsquo;t motivating to test. Fight the client, get a better scope and understanding - you want to be sure this target is pointless before you deem it so.</p><h2 id=target>Target</h2><p>When dealing with your target:</p><ul><li>Know what the thing is, know why it&rsquo;s important, know what the worst case is for this thing, and then make that happen.</li><li>Make a threat model, get a whiteboard, draw the thing up, ask a colleague about it. Do this before you start the testing.</li></ul><p>Some would call it &ldquo;goals-based testing&rdquo;, others would just say &ldquo;doing your job&rdquo; - The author fits in the latter camp.</p><h2 id=reporting>Reporting</h2><ul><li>Be aware that the stuff you raise will have a cost to fix; ensure your recommendations are suitable, are appropriate, fix the issue - and most importantly, are tailored to the client.</li><li>Be aware of generic writeups and templates, these make people lazy, and without context, reports are meaningless.</li><li>Write your report like it&rsquo;s going directly to the client; pretend the people doing QA are asleep.</li><li>Participate in peer review, early and often. Ask for feedback on a writeup, give feedback to others. It will make you a better tester.</li><li>When doing QA, ensure you don&rsquo;t let mediocre reports pass.</li></ul><h2 id=misc>Misc</h2><p>When doing anything:</p><ul><li>Know how things work. Look into frameworks, look at tech stack, deeply understand what is going on.</li><li>Poc||GTFO. If you&rsquo;ve got a bug, build a proof of concept, test it, dump that in the report.<ul><li>If it&rsquo;s XSS, don&rsquo;t <code>alert(1)</code>; do something funky in the app.</li></ul></li><li>Know the value in your work is from the report; give it the effort it deserves.</li></ul></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div></div></nav></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','UA-141761824-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
