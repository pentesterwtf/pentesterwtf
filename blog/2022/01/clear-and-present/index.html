"""
AD is a system where any time you hack any computer on the network, you can become the domain controller, and
own the whole company. That&rsquo;s just how it works. Every hacker/penetration tester has known that for two decades and the specific incantation on how
you do that changes slowly over time, but it&rsquo;s always true.
"""</p><p>Being a penetration tester for what seems like either &ldquo;a while&rdquo;, &ldquo;long enough&rdquo;, or perhaps &ldquo;too bloody long&rdquo;, I know the above to be accurate; there&rsquo;s always another iteration of some form of Potato, be it <a href=https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/01/16/hot-potato/>hot</a>, <a href=https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/09/26/rotten-potato-privilege-escalation-from-service-accounts-to-system/>rotten</a>, some kind of <a href=https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/cve-2021-34527>nightmare</a>, or just some long-standing issue with cryptography using all zeroes in a nonce, like <a href=https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/>zerologin</a>.</p><p>BloodHound seemed to make this a significantly easier problem to enumerate (and exploit), and efforts were made to &ldquo;automate the specific incantation&rdquo; on becoming the domain controller (<a href=https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/DeathStar>Like Deathstar</a>), but ultimately - it seems like a lost fight.</p><p>Microsoft seems to be in a situation where they&rsquo;ve put all efforts into making Azure perform worse than Linode (<a href=https://elixirforum.com/t/azure-disk-i-o-performance-is-extremely-low-compared-to-other-cloud-providers/24446);>https://elixirforum.com/t/azure-disk-i-o-performance-is-extremely-low-compared-to-other-cloud-providers/24446);</a> with the security aspects being about as bad. With efforts going into Azure, everything on-prem performing as poorly with the series of Exchange issues and the reimplementation of the Y2k bug (<a href=https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863950/microsoft-exchange-y2k22-bug);>https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863950/microsoft-exchange-y2k22-bug);</a> ironically in the Security component (The antimalware engine).</p><p>With a vendor who seems to have given up on anything on-prem while producing terrible &ldquo;as a service&rdquo; offerings, it&rsquo;s unclear why anyone would want to stay with this line of products.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the solution? Aitel nails it by picking understandable technology and going as far as to say, &ldquo;the TL;DR is just use Google as your directory server and use Chromebooks as much as possible.&rdquo;, which I agree with - make everything a web app (Web Assembly is pretty nice at this point too) and buy more Chromebooks - get rid of Active Directory.</p></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div></div></nav></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','UA-141761824-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
